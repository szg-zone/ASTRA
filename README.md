## Overview

ASTRA combines global orbital awareness, public RF observation integration, spacecraft anomaly detection, and operator-validated Adaptive Event Memory.

It addresses a spacecraft operations problem: **rare but legitimate behavior can repeatedly trigger anomaly alarms, leaving operators to reassess patterns they have already validated.**

The repository includes:

- FastAPI backend
- Next.js / React operator interface under `FrontEnd 2.0/` (legacy static interface remains under `app/frontend/`)
- CelesTrak catalog ingestion with local SGP4 propagation
- SatNOGS observation integration
- Anomaly-detection baselines
- Adaptive Event Memory workflow evaluated on historical ESA Mission-1 telemetry
- Single-service Docker / Railway deployment configuration

Public orbital data, public RF observations, and historical research telemetry remain separate. **No authorized live mission feed is connected.**

Adaptive Event Memory lets operators validate an unusual operational pattern and recognize similar future events using telemetry signatures and operational context. The research question is whether this can reduce repeated rare-nominal alarms without materially reducing genuine-anomaly recall. The current evidence is exploratory and specific to a selected Mission-1 subset.

---

## Problem

Anomaly detectors can repeatedly flag rare but legitimate spacecraft behavior. Repeated alarms create **alarm fatigue** and consume operator attention that could otherwise go to unfamiliar or genuinely anomalous events.

Operators need context, supporting evidence, and memory of previously validated operational patterns. ASTRA supports that review; **it does not diagnose physical root cause.**

---

## Core Idea

```
Telemetry
  -> anomaly detector
  -> event signature
  -> operational context
  -> similarity search
  -> operator validation
  -> event memory
  -> known operational pattern recognition
```

The first occurrence of an unfamiliar event is still surfaced. An operator reviews the evidence and validates whether it represents a legitimate operation.

Only validated operational patterns enter the memory used for operational-pattern recognition. Future similar events can then be recognized.

Unmatched events remain unusual events requiring review, and the operator stays in control.

---

## Capabilities

| Workspace / Capability | Current Scope |
| --- | --- |
| **GLOBAL** | CelesTrak public active satellite catalog using GP/OMM orbital elements; local SGP4 propagation for current estimated position, altitude, velocity, and orbit paths; ground-contact/pass context, object search, and source freshness/provenance. |
| **RF OBSERVATIONS** | SatNOGS Community Ground Network integration in the object inspector: recent RF observations, raw frames, decoded telemetry only when genuinely available, explicit availability states, caching, and source-failure handling. |
| **FLEET** | Reserved for authorized mission spacecraft; intentionally empty when no authorized feed is connected. |
| **SPACECRAFT** | Workspace for authorized mission telemetry. Currently shows the disconnected state and does not fabricate spacecraft telemetry. |
| **ALERTS** | Unusual-event and known-operational-pattern status from the historical research workflow. |
| **OPERATIONS** | Adaptive Event Memory, event evidence, and operator validation using prepared historical research scenarios. |
| **DATA SOURCES** | Provider health, source attribution, and cache/freshness state. |
| **RESEARCH** | ESA Mission-1 exploratory evaluation on selected telemetry channels. |

These sources are separate and not interchangeable. Orbital elements support propagated orbital awareness, RF observations describe public reception activity and available payloads, and ESA telemetry supports historical research. None establishes access to an authorized operational mission feed.

## Adaptive Event Memory

Event signatures summarize an event window using:

- Duration
- Affected channels
- Telemetry statistics
- Detector-score features

Telecommand/context features include command timing and nearby command counts. **Command proximity is contextual evidence, not proof of causation.**

Similarity matching combines:

- Feature-vector cosine similarity
- Affected-channel overlap
- Command-context proximity

A score-discrepancy guard conservatively rejects some matches when an event is substantially more anomalous than its stored operational counterpart.

Thresholds and these safeguards require mission-specific validation; they do not guarantee that every anomaly remains visible. The SQLite-backed memory queries records validated as `VALID_OPERATION`. Confirmed-anomaly records can be recorded separately but are excluded from operational-pattern matching.

The current backend uses an in-memory database, so its operator memory is **session-local**.

Ground-truth category labels are not inference features in the signature or similarity calculation. The historical experiment does use labelled event windows and labels to simulate operator feedback and evaluate outcomes. This is a retrospective simulation, not a prospective operational trial.

## Research Evaluation

### Exploratory Mission-1 Evaluation

On the exploratory ESA Mission-1 subset:

- The 3σ GlobalStd detector identified **25 of 29** labelled genuine anomaly windows (**86.2%**).
- **5 of 36** labelled Rare Event windows triggered detector alarms.
- Adaptive Event Memory reduced those five detector alarms to **4**.
- Event Memory suppressed **none** of the 25 detected genuine anomalies.

In a separate retrospective, label-conditioned memory-stage recurrence study, **27 of 36 Rare Event windows** were subsequently recognized as previously learned operational patterns, reducing repeated operator review by **75.0%**.

The end-to-end detector evaluation and the retrospective memory-stage recurrence study are separate evaluations with different denominators.

### Reported Metrics

| Metric                                                 | Result              |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| Genuine anomaly detection before and after memory      | **25 / 29 = 86.2%** |
| Rare Event detector alarms before Event Memory         | **5**               |
| Rare Event detector alarms after Event Memory          | **4**               |
| End-to-end Rare Event detector-alarm reduction         | **20.0%**           |
| Detected genuine anomalies suppressed by Event Memory  | **0 / 25**          |
| Retrospective memory-stage Rare Event recognition      | **27 / 36 = 75.0%** |
| Review-required Rare Event windows in recurrence study | **9 / 36**          |

**Important:** 27/36 is a label-conditioned retrospective memory-stage recurrence measurement. It is **not** an end-to-end detector alarm count. The 75.0% value measures repeated-review reduction in that separate study. This is an exploratory Mission-1 evaluation, **not a pristine untouched final benchmark**. Thresholds and memory behavior were developed while inspecting Mission-1. Cross-mission validation remains future work. Reproduction under frozen thresholds and an untouched evaluation protocol is required before generalization claims.

Both studies use `CH_41–CH_46`, anonymized research telemetry channels, and similarity threshold `0.80`. Labels define historical event windows and simulate operator review; they are not similarity features. The existing neighboring-sample fallback for empty windows is retained. Repeated-review reduction counts windows relative to reviewing every cohort window; it is not a measurement of operator time saved.

### Reproduce the Studies

```
uv run python scripts/run_memory_experiment.py
uv run python scripts/run_memory_stage_recurrence_experiment.py
```

See:

- `reports/astra_memory_experiment.md`
- `reports/astra_memory_stage_recurrence.md`
- `reports/astra_context_ablation.md`

The context-ablation report is separate from the two headline studies.

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- Python 3.11
- uv
- Node.js and npm (for `FrontEnd 2.0/`)
- Docker (optional, to reproduce the production image)
- Network access for live CelesTrak/SatNOGS providers
- Separately prepared research data only when reproducing the ESA research experiments

### Install

```
git clone https://github.com/TanayP26/ASTRA.git
cd ASTRA
uv sync --extra dev
```

### Run the Operator Interface

Start the FastAPI backend:

```
uv run uvicorn app.backend.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8050
```

In a second terminal:

```
cd "FrontEnd 2.0"
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open the Next.js URL shown in the terminal (normally `http://localhost:3000`). FrontEnd 2.0 proxies `/api/*` to the FastAPI backend and connects the selected-object WebSocket directly to port 8050.

The FastAPI root still serves the legacy static interface for compatibility.

Open the Next.js URL shown in the terminal (normally `http://localhost:3000`). The nationals frontend proxies `/api/*` to the FastAPI backend and connects the selected-object WebSocket directly to port 8050.

The FastAPI root still serves the legacy static interface for compatibility.

### Checks

Backend:

```
uv run pytest
uv run ruff check .
```

Frontend production build:

```
cd "FrontEnd 2.0"
npm run build
```

Run the backend tests, Ruff, and the FrontEnd 2.0 production build before merging.

Historical research experiments require separately prepared local ESA data. The prepared historical event workflow is reproducible from the version-controlled `configs/demo_scenarios.json` scenario definitions.

### Railway Deployment

The recommended SIH deployment is **one Railway service** from the repository root.

The root `Dockerfile` builds FrontEnd 2.0 as a static Next.js export, copies that build into `app/frontend`, and then runs the FastAPI backend. This gives ASTRA one public origin for the UI, REST API, and WebSocket connection, avoiding cross-origin configuration and a second frontend cold start.

Railway uses the root `railway.toml` and checks `/health`. No frontend/backend URL environment variables are required for the single-service deployment.

To reproduce the production image locally:

```
```bash
docker build -t astra .
docker run --rm -p 8050:8050 -e PORT=8050 astra
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8050`. In the production container this serves FrontEnd 2.0, while a normal local Uvicorn run still serves the legacy static shell unless the frontend has been built into `app/frontend`.

A separate Next.js service remains possible using `FrontEnd 2.0/Dockerfile`; in that topology set `ASTRA_BACKEND_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL` on the frontend and configure `ASTRA_FRONTEND_URL` / `ASTRA_CORS_ORIGINS` on the backend.

---

## Important Data Requirements

- ESA raw and processed research data is not bundled in GitHub because of size, licensing, and data-handling constraints.
- Obtain the data separately under the applicable source terms.
- Keep raw inputs immutable under `data/raw/`.
- Reproducible transformations belong under `data/interim/` and `data/processed/`.
- CelesTrak and SatNOGS public-source access depends on network and upstream availability.
- Cached data may be stale; freshness and failure states must be considered.
- Without a usable cache or network access, source data may be unavailable.

---

## Current Prototype Status

ASTRA is a **research and engineering prototype suitable for SIH evaluation**.

It is not:

- Flight-certified
- Connected to ISRO mission telemetry
- Production-proven in spacecraft operations
- An autonomous spacecraft controller

---

## Limitations

- Exploratory evidence covers only Mission-1 channels 41–46; cross-mission generalization remains unvalidated.
- Historical event windows and simulated operator feedback limit claims about end-to-end operational detection.
- No authorized live mission feed is connected; public RF telemetry availability varies.
- Public orbital state is propagated from orbital elements, not direct onboard telemetry.
- Backend Event Memory is session-local; durable feedback governance remains future work.

---

## Future Work

- Authorized CCSDS/MQTT/Kafka/WebSocket mission telemetry adapters
- Mission-specific calibration and cross-mission evaluation
- Reproduction under frozen thresholds and an untouched evaluation protocol
- Richer operator-feedback governance, including memory revocation and versioning
- Stronger anomaly detectors evaluated against interpretable baselines
- Deployment and security hardening
